# Card Games

This project involves writing a program to manipulate a standard deck of cards, occasionally implementing games (e.g., blackjack, etc.) around the card manipulation implementation.

## Implementations

- [Java Implementation](./java/README.md): full CLI-based blackjack game implementation, OOP
- [TypeScript Implementation](./typescript/README.md): simple card, deck, players and game implementation, OOP
- [Python Implementation](./python/README.md): ranking randomized poker hands, functional
