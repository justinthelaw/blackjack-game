# Card Games

This project involves writing CLI-based programs to manipulate a standard deck of cards. Occasionally, depending on how I feel, there are implementations of various games (e.g., blackjack, etc.) on top of the basic card manipulation implementation.

## Implementations

- [Java Implementation](./java/README.md): a fully interactive blackjack game implementation, OOP
- [TypeScript Implementation](./typescript/README.md): a simple card, deck, players and game implementation, OOP
- [Python Implementation](./python/README.md): a ranking implementation for randomized poker hands, functional
